    <br>     From formal hellos to effortless talks, <br>
         I smile whenever i remember how we started, <br>
        Our weird connection grew, with laughter and talks,<br>
        You showed me simplicity and genuine care  <br>
        You're my one rare find, totally beyond compare.<br
         <i>(spoilers: dont be hyped oh, i had to find words that rhyme, 
            you not that nice, you like laughing alone sometimes)  </i> <br/>
        <br/>

        
        Your strength and resilience inspires me <br>
        I get this new belief and strength in myself, whenever we talk <br>
        I wish i have an all day chance, with you, to just talk and walk <br>
        You're a constant presence that exudes peace <br>
        <i>(spoilers: that wish up there, that walk and talk day, <br>
            i'd so much appreciate beating you back, 
         <br> for all of my scores that you won, for all of those counts that you stole, all of those beatings you owe me) </i> <br/>
       <br/>
        
        B, youre more than just a friendly face, <br>
        You're my guiding light in life's busy pace. <br>
        Your kindness and heart is a precious find, <br>
        You're my one big treasure, one of a kind. <br>
        <i>(spoilers: i thought there was no spoiler since this is like realest of this write, 
        but, your face isn't that friendly) </i><br/>
            <br>
            
         We've had our space, but our connects would remain, <br>
        Through joy and on days of fears, <br>
        I'm here for you, to remind you of your inner mights, <br>
        Through every fall, we'll rise and stand together. <br>
         We'll help us shine, through endless nights <br>
        Cause i believe in you, just like you would in me, anytime, anyday <br>
        You're the strong beautiful Bukunmi that deserves the bright shinning life <br>
        You're the smile in my every beautiful days <br>
